        </div>
        <div class="col col-sm-12 col-md-6">
            <p>My name is Sofia Aguiar and I am a passionate and dedicated graphic designer with a degree from Middlesex
                University in
                London. My love for design began at a young age, when I studied for 10 years at a music school where I
                learned to play
                the piano and guitar. This passion for music stayed with me throughout my life, and I went on to attend
                an
                arts school
                for high school and then to London for university to study graphic design.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work with a variety of clients and bring their
                visions
                to life
                through my designs. As a Graphic Designer at CoLAB +ATLANTIC, I am responsible for all internal
                communication design and
                communication materials inside work packages for outside projects involving European organisations. I
                pride
                myself on
                having a strong eye for detail and being skilled in a wide range of design software, including Adobe
                Creative Suite. I
                am also experienced in project management, ensuring that all of my projects are delivered on time and to
                the
                highest
                standards.

            </p>
            <p>
                One of the things that I learned while studying music at school is how to manage my time effectively
                between
                normal
                school classes and music classes. This experience taught me how to prioritize tasks and manage a busy
                schedule, which
                has served me well in my career as a graphic designer.

            </p>
            <p>
                When I am not working, I love to travel and explore new places. I also enjoy staying active and
                participating in outdoor
                activities such as surfing and surf skating. My love for music, the sea and museums has not waned over
                the
                years and I
                still enjoy spending time with my friends and family and going for long walks through the Portuguese
                coast.
